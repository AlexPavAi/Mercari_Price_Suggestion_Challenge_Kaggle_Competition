# Mercari_Price_Suggestion_Challenge_Kaggle_Competition
The repo contains my solution for the kaggle challenge of giving a price suggestion to a new prodcut,
based on his categorical and continues parameters as described by the seller - based on a big database of existing products 
in the Mercari market.

the solution consists of:
1) Data pre-precessing: cleaning the data and leaving important names - using TF-IDF.
2) Using a regressor model of the embedded data + the continues as input, and the price as output
3) Data post processing - cleaning outliers.
